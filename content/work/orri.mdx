## The Challenge

Orri needed a secure, accessible platform for managing eating disorder treatment, starting from scratch.

## The Approach

I designed the frontend architecture with a focus on maintainability, accessibility, and developer experience.

### Key Deliverables

- **TypeScript SDK** for API interactions
- **Design system foundations** using a component library
- **Accessibility-first** component patterns
- **Testing strategy** with unit and integration tests

## Outcome

The architecture provided a solid foundation for the team to build upon, with clear patterns and excellent developer experience.
