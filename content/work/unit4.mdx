## The Challenge

Unit4 needed a unified design system that could work across multiple products built with different frameworks.

## The Solution

I architected a design system built on web components with React wrapper components, distributed via an Nx monorepo.

### Technical Decisions

- **Web Components** for framework agnosticism
- **React wrappers** for developer experience
- **Nx** for monorepo tooling and caching
- **Storybook** for documentation and visual testing

## Adoption

Within 6 months, 3 teams across 4 products had adopted the design system, improving consistency and reducing development time.
