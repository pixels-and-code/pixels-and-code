## The Challenge

Birdie's frontend application had grown significantly, and performance issues were impacting user experience in critical workflows.

## The Approach

I built a comprehensive Playwright-based performance testing suite that could measure real-world user journey times and identify specific bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline.

### Key Achievements

- Reduced initial page load time by 40%
- Implemented code splitting strategies that cut bundle sizes in half
- Established performance budgets and automated monitoring

## Results

The performance improvements led to measurably better user engagement and satisfaction scores.
